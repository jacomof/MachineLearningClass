# MachineLearningClass
This is the repository for my final project of a class I took on Machine Learning. I developed it in conjunction with my classmate, Judith VÃ¡zquez Valero. It analyzes a dataset of Airbnbs and tries to predict their price using several methods, both lineal and nonlinear. The machine learning library used is scikit-learn.
The project was developed using Google Colab's notebooks, which is a tool from Google that allows you to store and execute jupyter notebooks.
